//In Git, the commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit. In many cases, the most recently made commit is the HEAD commit.

8.git show HEAD....shows latest commit!!!!!

What if you decide to change the some lines in the working directory, but then decide you wanted to discard that change?

You could rewrite the line how it was originally, but what if you forgot the exact wording? The command

9. git checkout HEAD filename

will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit.

//we can add more than one file to staging as follows
10.git add filename_1 filename_2 filename_3

//we can unstage a file from staging
11.git reset HEAD filename
